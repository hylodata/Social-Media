            <h1 class="intro__hed">The Social Media Information Gap</h1>
            <p class="intro__dek">
              For many new immigrants, there are various challenges associated with settling into a new country. Before coming to Canada, a significant number of prospective immigrants spend time searching through social media for information. They turn to some platforms, like Facebook and LinkedIn, more than others, and the preferred platform tends to differ according to factors like gender and country of origin, as well as the type of information that is searched for. If social media has the potential to reduce the challenges associated with settlement, is it as effective as it could be?<br> <br> We carried out a study in which we asked 500 recent immigrants to Canada bout their social media use and how it might have helped them learn about work prospects. At the same time, we learned that only around 20% of SSPOs use social media extensively. In order to optimize their communication strategies, SSPOs need to be aware of the various platforms and types of information that prospective immigrants search for, as well as the long-term labour market outcomes new immigrants face. Building this knowledge will make it easier for SSPOs to develop capacity with platforms that are a good match for the sercies and information they provide.<br> <br> In the analysis that follows, we examine labour market outcomes linked to social media use by recent immigrants at three distinct stages: pre-arrival, information gathering, and post-arrival.

            <h2 class="section__hed">Pre-Arrival Search and Communication</h2>
            <p class="prearrival__dek">
                A high percentage of incoming immigrants search for information about work prospects before coming to Canada. As many as 65% (n=263) of surveyed pre-arrival newcomers are social media users. 82% (n=288) of surveyed pre-arrival newcomers connected with a person or group regarding immigration before coming to Canada. Facebook, for example, is almost as important as making a direct email or phone call, and more frequently used than instant messaging services. Other important social media information resources include LinkedIn, QZone, and online discussion forums.

            <p class="prearrival__dek">
                If we examine this data along gendered lines, an important difference appears. Men prefer email or telephone-based communication.

            <h2 class="section__hed">Mixing Resources</h2>
            <p class="prearrival__dek">
                While new immigrants are combing the social media environment for information and services, they primarily rely on a few key methods and platforms to find information about the Canadian labour market. For example, when searching for occupational licensing requirements, they typically rely on email or telephone contact with people in their network. When seeking job search and job interview advice, or salary information, they turn to LinkedIn more than any other platform. Use the interactive buttons below to see which resources immigrants use to seek various different types of information.</p>

            <p class="prearrival__dek">
                When surveying new immigrants, we also asked what their settlement experience was like. Did they find all of the information they were looking for? What other experiences did they encounter when trying to access labour market information? A significant number of respondents (n=166) experienced misinformation, and a smaller number experienced issues like fraud and identity theft (n=67), and even discrimination (n=13). A sizable portion (n=99) didn't have confidence in the information they were finding on social media.

            <h2 class="section__hed">Post-Arrival Labour Outcomes</h2>
            <p class="prearrival__dek">
              How did the use of social media affect newcomers' ability to establish themselves in the Canadian labour market? In the first six months of arrival, those who <b style="color: #8a8a8a; background-color: #ffdc00">used social media before arrival</b> had a nearly 3-to-1 advantage in getting established in the labour market versus those who <b style="color: #004c9b;">did not use social media before arrival</b>. Importantly, social media users appear to be more likely to find work that matches their credentials. SSPOs need to recognize that this gap exists and help develop a better understanding of why social media is linked to better labour market outcomes. These graphs depict differences in employment outcomes between those who used social media before arrival to search for labour market information and those who did not.

	    <p class="prearrival__dek">
              Notably, a correlation between social media use and higher-paying jobs also emerged in our study. Nearly 80% of immigrants who secured high-paying jobs <b style="color: #8a8a8a; background-color: #ffdc00">used social media before arrival</b>, while nearly 75% of immigrants who gained precarious, low-paying employment <b style="color: #004c9b;">did not use social media before arrival</b>. These graphs depict differences in earnings between those who used social media before arrival to search for labour market information and those who did not.
